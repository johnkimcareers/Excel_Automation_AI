### Documentation for `Assignment` Class

#### Overview
The `Assignment` class is designed to handle the processing of educational assignment data. It reads and processes data from Excel files and Word documents to generate structured feedback documents. The class utilizes AI services provided by OpenAI to interpret and categorize text from assignments according to predefined rubrics.

#### Dependencies
- **os**: Operating system interface, used here to manage environment variables.
- **docx**: Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.
- **pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library, used to read Excel files.
- **json**: Library for JSON parsing and serialization.
- **openai**: OpenAI's Python client library, used to interact with OpenAI's API.

#### Class Attributes
- **template_rubric**: Dictionary to store the structured template of rubrics.
- **student_responses**: Dictionary to store the responses extracted from the student's assignments.
- **student_graded_rubrics**: Dictionary to store the evaluated rubrics against the student responses.

#### Methods

##### `__init__(self, rubric_file_name)`
Constructor that initializes the `Assignment` instance.
- **Parameters**:
  - `rubric_file_name`: Path to the Excel file containing the rubric templates.

##### `load_json(self, file_path)`
Loads a JSON file and returns its contents.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_path`: Path to the JSON file.
- **Returns**:
  - The data from the JSON file, or `None` if the file is not found or the JSON is invalid.

##### `read_excel(self, file_name)`
Reads an Excel file and returns its column indices and data as a DataFrame.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_name`: Path to the Excel file.
- **Returns**:
  - A tuple containing the initial column index, the DataFrame of the Excel content, the number of rows, and the number of columns.

##### `setup(self, file_name)`
Sets up the initial rubric template based on the Excel file provided.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_name`: Path to the Excel file containing the rubric setup.

##### `parse_assignment(self, file_name)`
Processes a Word document to extract student responses and categorizes them using OpenAI's API.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_name`: Path to the Word document to be processed.

##### `parse_marked_rubric(self, file_name)`
Processes a marked rubric Excel file to extract and store rubric assessments.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_name`: Path to the Excel file with marked rubrics.

##### `create_example_doc(self)`
Generates a Word document compiling the responses and corresponding rubrics.
- **Output**:
  - Creates a Word document named `responses.docx` with all processed data.

##### `get_marked_rubric(self)`
Returns the dictionary containing the graded rubrics.
- **Returns**:
  - A dictionary of graded rubrics.

##### `get_question_keys(self)`
Returns the keys used in questions from the rubrics.
- **Returns**:
  - A list of question keys from the rubrics.

#### Usage Example
```python
assignment_processor = Assignment("path/to/rubric_file.xlsx")
assignment_processor.parse_assignment("path/to/student_assignment.docx")
assignment_processor.parse_marked_rubric("path/to/graded_rubric.xlsx")
assignment_processor.create_example_doc()
```

This documentation outlines the functionality and usage of the `Assignment` class, designed to facilitate automated handling and feedback generation for educational assignments using AI technology.

### Documentation for `process_files` Function in Markdown Format

#### Overview
The `process_files` function in `main.py` is designed to automate the processing of student assignments stored in Word documents (.docx) and their corresponding rubric assessments in Excel files (.xlsx). It leverages the `Assignment` class for the parsing and handling of these files.

#### Dependencies
- **dotenv**: Library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **os**: Module to interact with the operating system, used for file path operations and environment variable management.
- **glob**: Module to find all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.
- **assignment**: Module containing the `Assignment` class.

#### Function Description

##### `process_files(base_directory)`
Processes files in a specified base directory by searching for matching .docx and .xlsx files, ensuring they align appropriately, and then parsing them using the `Assignment` class methods.

- **Parameters**:
  - `base_directory`: The path to the directory containing the folders of assignment documents and rubrics.

#### Detailed Workflow
1. **Load Environment Variables**: Initializes environment variables using `load_dotenv()`.
2. **List Subdirectories**: Retrieves all subdirectories within the specified `base_directory`.
3. **Initialize Assignment Object**: Creates an instance of the `Assignment` class with a specified Excel file containing rubric templates.
4. **File Matching and Processing**:
   - Uses the `glob` module to find all .docx and .xlsx files within each subdirectory that match specified patterns.
   - Sorts the files to align documents with their corresponding rubrics.
   - Checks if file base names match (ignoring specific identifiers like 'rubric' in rubric files) and processes matched files using methods from the `Assignment` class.
5. **Error Handling**: Outputs a warning if files are mismatched or not aligned correctly.
6. **Document Generation**: Calls the `create_example_doc()` method of the `Assignment` class to compile and save the processed data into a Word document.

#### Usage Example
```python
base_directory = '/path/to/assignment/folder'
process_files(base_directory)
```

This function is part of a larger system intended for educational institutions or educators to automate the assessment and feedback generation process for student assignments. It requires the presence of the `Assignment` class within the `assignment` module, which must be implemented with methods capable of handling specific parsing and document generation tasks.
